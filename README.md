Description
An online dictionary web app that fetches word definitions, examples and pronunciations from a dictionary API.

# API USED 
dictionaryapi.dev

# CORE FEATURES
1. Word definitions 
2. Examples 
3. Pronunciations 

# Basic story of the project (User story)
1. As a user, you’re able to look up the meaning of a word 
2. As a user, you’re able to see examples of how a word is used 
3. As a user, you’re able to hear the correct pronunciation of a word
4. As a user, you’re able to see synonyms of a word 
5. As a user, you’re able to see antonyms of a word

# How to Use
Enter the word you want to look up and there you the word definition, examples and pronunciation. 

# Challenges faced 
1. API limits, that is, the API may lack the meanings of new English words.
2. Data inaccuracies, for example, some words may have inaccurate definitions and usages.
3. Cross browser compatibility issues because different browsers interpret HTML, CSS & JavaScript differently hence different results."
